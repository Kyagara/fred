# Fred

The main goal with this mod is to add some quality of life features that would normally need another mod to be installed, things my friends and I find funny and to practice some java along the way.

- The name was the first thing a friend said after I asked for a project name.
- The mod icon is my friend's doggo :), no idea of what to actually use.
- This mod was originally developed for a private modpack.
- I don't plan on making a Forge version.
- New features might be available only on newer versions.

> Most features are configurable.

## Features

- Movement with screens open (inventory, crafting table and a lot more).
