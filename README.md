# Fred

The main goal with this mod is to add some quality of life features that would normally need another mod to be installed, things my friends and I find funny.

- The name was the first thing a friend said after I asked for a project name.
- The mod icon is my friend's doggo :), no idea of what to actually use.
- This mod was originally developed for a private modpack.
- Some features have been moved to [CoopTweaks](https://github.com/Kyagara/CoopTweaks).
- NeoForge version is not ready yet.
