# Fred :)

Mod developed for a modpack for some friends. I don't plan on doing any backports for now.

The main goal with this mod is just to practice some Java with minecraft modding and add some things we find funny as items.

-   Followed tutorials from [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_).
-   Most of the Trumpet code came from [trumpet-skeleton-fabric](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/trumpet-skeleton-fabric/).
-   The texture, model and sound effect are also part of [trumpet-skeleton-fabric](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/trumpet-skeleton-fabric/).
-   The name was the first thing a friend said after I asked for a project name.
