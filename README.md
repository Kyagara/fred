# Fred :)

Mod developed for a private modpack for some friends. I don't plan on doing any backports.

The main goal with this mod is just to practice some Java with minecraft modding and add some things we find funny as items and features that would need another mod to be installed.

-   Followed tutorials from [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1EeLZggaXPJaARxnAbUD8Y_).
-   Most of the Trumpet code came from [trumpet-skeleton-fabric](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/trumpet-skeleton-fabric/).
-   The name was the first thing a friend said after I asked for a project name.
-   Yes, that's Tyler1 in the mod icon.
-   :)
